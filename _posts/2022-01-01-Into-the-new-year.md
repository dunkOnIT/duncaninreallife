Well, 2022 has started. One of the least ceremonius starts to a year for me, but also one of the least existentially terrifying - so that's nice. I can probably attribute that to a decent end to the year, in the sense that work went pretty well and I got to do a lot of coding stuff, so it feels like I'm ending the year on a win. 

I'm in a space at the moment where asking big questions about who I am and who I want to be seems both intimidating and like too much song-and-dance. I'm making small steps in the right direction at the moment, let me think about how to keep making those.

A big reason these steps have started to happen is because I've started getting to do work that I really enjoy - it would be good to remember that. 

# Reflections on last year 

## Highlights 

* I had some time after Mthunzi to just stream multiblind - I look back on that time really fondly. There was a chunk of time where I could really just focus on multi and have a good time streaming
  * Birthday stream with Viv was really fun
  * Sad I didn't make more progress on multi though
* New World release month was a fun time
* The last 2 weeks of December when everyone was on leave and I just got to play with a bunch of code stuff 
* The couple of phone calls I got to have with Tazzlyn
* Getting to know Sig a bit more and chatting to him about MBLD stuff was a vibe 
* Made huge strides in dealing with my anxiety this year, largely thanks to reflecting on the last year. Getting diagnosed with anxiety issues and starting medication was a huge turning point for me. 

## Letdowns

* Savings depleted very quickly when I was off work - our monthly spending this year was very high
* The second half of the year got pretty boring/monotonous, and my focus was very split - self-maintenance (exercise, physio), house maintenance (cleaning, cooking, chores/admin), work, learning to code, hobbies. It was pretty all over the place. 
* Not continuing with MBLD / constantly getting injured and eventually getting demotivated 
* I got into cubing.js and started talking to the WST, but then had to drop those because there wasn't enough capacity
* We don't really have community, and didn't take many steps to building one
  * Although I did meet some cool people during the anti-bias training at CMM that it would be cool to connect further with 
* Didn't really have a consistent way of reflecting - didn't keep up counselling with Nikki or sessions with Brett

## Learning

* Coworking streams really help me focus
  * Streaming in general I really enjoy, but difficulties in the community are a huge thing


## General comments

* The work I've been doing in the latter half of the year hasn't been very stimulating/exciting - though I am fortunate that it has paid well
  * Mthunzi was an incredible opportunity that really grew my skillset, though
* Despite a brief experiment with digital minimalism, I'm still living a fairly distracted/unpresent life
  * This blogging thing did work well for a while, though - maybe I should give it another shot? 
* In general, I've had to drop a few things I've been excited about/cared about this year - because of injury, because of finances, or to support Viv.
* Most of my community/connections have been online instead of in-person - Max and Freya, Sig and rest of people I met/got to know better through streaming - Tazz, Jupi, Dreim, Dylan and Josh, Scalpel and so many more. 


# Looking to the year ahead 

## Things I could focus on for next year 

* MBLD practice
* Exercise and diet
* Work
* Learning coding
* Mental health 
  * Journalling, seeing someone like Brett
* Living more presently/silently
  * Less video games 
  * Less youtube
* Better control of finances

## Things I need/want to start off focusing on

* Exercise and diet
* Maintaining the house
* Learning coding 
* Keeping up with work

Maybes (these probably feel like too much atm):
* MBLD reviewing comms and letter pairs
* Managing finances 

Overall, it feels like this current mix of stuff is sustainable, along with Apex as a break/fun thing for me to do that doesn't demand much and is fun. 

## Actions 

* Exercise and diet
  * Make a fitness goals page
  * Make a leg fitness plan


* Maintaining the house
  * Learn new recipes? Set up organisations systems? Not sure if there are any actions here.

* Learning coding 
  * Make a list of potential projects

## Shorter-term goals: 

* Be walking-fit for Alexandria. (Basically 20km per day... damn)
  * Means I need to do a bunch of leg/hip physio, and make a plan for that
