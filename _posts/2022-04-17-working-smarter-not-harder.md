Heading into this week, I'm a bit behind on work. Been a bit split on priorities - moving, feeling bad about WST, work, health/exercise, cubing, working on my flashcard trainer.

Made huge progress on my flashcard trainer last week which is incredibly exciting, but it means that I really need to focus in on work this coming week.

At times like this, I'm tempted to just try and *grind* out work, but that leads to exhaustion, overwhelm, and burnout. 

Instead, I want to literally *focus* on work. Let me show up well, plan well, be focused on what I'm trying to achieve, and not waste time berating myself for not working better in the past. I'm in a fairly optimistic space at the moment which is quite nice, so hopefully I can carry that energy into tomorrow and just get focused work done on the Investor Database.

One other thought relating to work: I'm struggling to get into flow state with some of the spreadsheet stuff - its too boring/monotonous, creating too much opportunity for me to just be anxious. I think doing something to increase the difficulty of it - perhaps trying to speedrun it? - would help me get through it faster, and in a more focused way.

## Why am I in an optimistic space?

- Probably excited for the move to my parents
- Think that easter today went fine, and it feels like the relationship there is healing (though perhaps at the cost of me standing up for some of what I believe in?)
- Stoked to have a working version of my flashcard trainer out, and I feel like I got some really great feedback on it from Dale in particular that's going to help me improve as a developer. 
    - Also excited about refactoring it, and perhaps even doing some livestreaming of that process w/ Dale or Arjan. 
    - Just need to make sure that such a thought keeps its fairly low priority, that I don't let it take over!
- Injuries/pain are borderline, but under control :)
- Generally just feeling confident in myself at the moment. I think the long weekend and the pressure it removes have really helped there.
- I've really enjoyed getting some better/more automated systems set up on Windows for launching different projects - ueli + batch files are awesome :)
