Woken up from clenching my jaw during sleep for the first time in a while, and struggled to sleep due to anxiety. On the face of it this feels pretty strange, as ostensibly not much has changed in the last few days for me to be feeling more anxious. On closer inspection, however, I think two significant changes have taken place: 

* Transition from "holiday time" to "work time" 
* Uptick in personal admin

## Transition from holiday > work

Now, to be clear, I haven't transitioned from holiday - we worked through December. The last two weeks of December, when I knew that everyone was away and there were no expectations, were some of the best weeks of work I have ever experienced. No deadlines or distractions, just really being able to get to grips with the technical challenges and problem-solving of creating the Investor Portal. It was an absolute blast.

However, we're back in work-time, which means two things:
1. Splitting focus between different projects (systems change consulting and Investor Portal)
2. More real deadlines/meetings; confronting the potential for failure, and the reality that this project is taking *much* longer than I had initially anticipated. 

If I can figure out how to work with the lack of stress/awareness of deadlines that I had during December, that would be incredible. 

## Uptick in personal admin

There's probably a strong degree of financial anxiety here, as well. A bunch of stuff flying around - we just had to take our car in for repairs, I still need to get thet oxidisation of the paint sorted, and I'm waiting on making a huge Takealot order. 

Lots of small things to distract my focus and cause me stress as I keep coming back to thinking about them on a loop. 

Here, I think using my project tracker more aggressively would help.

Also, I haven't been doing my leg physio and that is stressing me out. I'm also worried I won't be able to do the family hike at the end of the month / scared it will cause injury. 

(My notion board maaaay be overcomplicated? Going to try using todoist instead perhaps. I think my main problem with that last time was filling it with waaaaaaaaay too much crap.)

# Attempted solutions:

1. Deliberately recognise that I'm not needed by anyone from work until my next meeting - try to really "disconnect" mentally, the way I did during December.
2. Use todoist to track ONLY THE STUFF I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO DO. The massive danger here is I use it for too much and get overwhelmed. "inbox" needs to live outside of Todoist. 

Ok. Writing this seems to have helped ease my anxiety. Have also set up a basic todoist scenario on a new account. Let's see if/how it lasts!
