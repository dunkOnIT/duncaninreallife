Bunch of ideas flying around in my head after getting back from holiday in the Eastern Cape (first with my family to attend Grandad's funeral, then with Viv's family camping).

* The sheer shock and weight of anxiety at returning to (a) the city / (b) normal life
  * I think part of what contributes to my anxiety here is the household management, which really encourages me to think in threat-seeking ways, and forces my focus to be split between tonnes of different tasks. 
  * A task management system/centralised plannign system would definitely help here, but (a) there's resistance in me to even setting up a system like that because of the time it would take, (b) I don't have a great track-record with productivity/planning systems that I need to use consistently. They all get taken by entropy eventually. 
* The desire to escape the city - Viv seems to be coming around to this idea more and more, and I've been looking at properties etc that we could get hold of and try and build on.
  * Being part of an eco-village feels like it would be ideal. But it doesn't seem easy to find/get into one. Or at least, they don't have open application processes lol. 
  * Perhaps its a two-stage process: First we get a little cottage/cabin/somethign for ourselves, learn to live quietly and get ourselves together, and then look to get onto a bigger property (mabye a farm?) and start/join like and eco-village/farm type deal
  * Building up practical skills, or finding something with practical skills, seems like it would be important: Particularly, farming and carpentry/DIY stuff
    * Perhaps these are skills which could be grown at a workaways or something? 
  * Been looking into various building methods as well, as maybe we could get onto one of my parents' plots, and I'm thinking about how we could do that as easily/quickly and cost-efficiently as possible. Tiny house seems like a lot of construction effort.
