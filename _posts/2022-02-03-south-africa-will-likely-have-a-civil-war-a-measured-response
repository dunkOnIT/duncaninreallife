I literally can't sleep because someone posted a clickbaity video about South Africa having a civil war, and now I'm perseverating over it. This is what I mean when I talk about needing to suppress my political streak/care for the world for the sake of my sanity/ability to continue funcitoning in the rat race that requires me to produce work at consistent intervals. Not to mention for the sake of my body which objects to bad sleep, which I've had for 3 nights running now.

Anyway. Let's watch the video.

# Timestamps:

0:29 - State about to fail. Source? Also, how does state failure = civil war?  

0:42 - "The growing unrest in the nation, nonsensical borders and pockets of diversity show people one thing - South Africa could likely have a civil war. And if not a civil war, the unrest will likely bring some sort of revolt or revolution in the nation. 

2 sources to downfall:
- Geography
- Unequal economy

# Geography

1:35 - Weird phrasing, which is actually kinda correct but also very misleading/not a good way of describing what you're talking about. Drakensberg = a portion of the Great Escarpement, not the whole thing.

3:30 - Apart from the painful pronunciations (literally, Google them), you're quoting mother tongues. English is almost universally spoken to at least some degree, with Afrikaans not far behind except in regions like KZN where dutch settlers weren't really around. Most speak English as a second language - yes.

# Demographics

4:00 - WHAT THE FUCK. We'll need a source for "one group taking over the country", lmao. The separate capitals are to represenate separation of governance and are arguably a good idea for many countries if you give it a bit of thought. 

4:33 - Hashim Amla would be considered coloured, but ok.

4:45 - Tale of two nations. Agree, but generalising the inequality and tension between white and black to demographic differences like different ethnic groups (Xhosa vs Zulu etc) is a huge mistake/leap in logic.

5:55 - "Historically and nowadays actively" - it was much more active during apart lmao.

7:10 - "Afrikaans is the main language of the cape" is a very debatable statement. 

7:30 - "Boer" might be the worst pronunciation yet, but maybe only because I'm so used to people butchering "Xhosa".

8:50 - Saying the ANC carried out guerilla warfare in response to apartheid is a wild and perhaps inappropriate generalisation. The MK (military wing of the ANC) was a thing, but I don't think its appropriate to characterise the ANC's resistance to apartheid purely in terms of guerilla resistance.

10:20 - "WILL" vs "could" is a huge distinction.

12:20 - "THE INEVITABLE" - fuck dude



# Ok I've written my comment now.

Feeling a lot less anxious, calmed down a lot. Definitely plenty of problematic/white-centric stuff being said in the comments, but the general consensus/rallying cry seems to be that civil war is a pretty bad take. And that's enough for now.
