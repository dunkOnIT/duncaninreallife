Just read a post on HackerNews about the importance of putting thoughts into words - essentially, the main thrust of their argument was that the rigour of putting thoughts into words causes us to clarify them to such a degree that if we aren't putting thoughts into words, it is very much like we aren't having them.

This is an interesting idea, and one that potentially explains my sense since I started working that I'm not really having many deeper thoughts anymore.

There are, in fact, a few reasons for this (and here I go through the process of my thoughts evolving as I write them): 
* less busy, more stressed = less time and capacity to think about things in the first place
* less interaction with friends = less deeper conversations = less exposure to different ideas and need to put thoughts into words in a social settings
* no longer being in a church community = less public speaking/teaching = no longer deliberately putting thoughts into words and trying to convey ideas.

These ideas in and of themselves form a powerful argument for trying to write more frequently - at least insofar as I want to keep honing my ability to have deep, somewhat original thoughts. Certainly if I want to move past the thin vapour and "vibes" that pass for my thoughts these days. 

Whether I will be able to find the time/inclination to in the midst of the vast swath of other things consuming my time and attention is a different matter
