Just had a really productive meeting with my therapist ngl. Their main suggestion was that I combat my feelings of overwhelm with structure, using that to clearly delineate what I focus on / worry about at any given time. I feel like my reasons for why I don't use structure more are pretty weak/unclear, and I haven't done a good job of observing what the issues I face when trying to implement structure are. 

While I have been wary of structure in the past, they made two points which I found very compelling: 
1. There are areas of my life where structure (automation) works very well for me. A great example is food - I've pretty much automated what I eat, and its basically eliminated all anxiety around food for me. 
2. I can use structure to ring-fence things like maintenance 

The key is going to be sticking to a structure, especially when:
1. I start feeling like I don't need it anymore
2. I just don't feel like doing it
3. It gets interrupted by something like injury or mental health

The other point they were making was around ways to reinforce that structure. For example, only doing Anuva work on Mondays/Fridays, travelling through to the office for it, etc. Doing stuff that really puts it in a very clearly separate space. 

The cost of moving my workspace around feels prohibitive at the moment given that I'd need to get a laptop set up, but I do like the idea in principle. I'm wondering how much I can use streaming to facilitate this - doing some sort of coworking stream perhaps? 

(I've been thinking about "quitting" cubing. Let's say this: I don't focus on it until I have good, sustainable structure in place. Then I re-evaluate.)

So, let's make up a structure now:
- No defined wake-up time - sleeping in seems to work well for me
- Start with 1hr exercise/physio, listening to productiviy-related podcast
- Anuva work until 1pm 
- Break until 3pm
- Coding rest of the day

With some other elements to note:
- Physio as I go (25 on/5 off)
- Bulk housework on Wednesdays
- Weekly reflection on Sundays (using a blog post as a basis)

Questions:
- When do I blog?
