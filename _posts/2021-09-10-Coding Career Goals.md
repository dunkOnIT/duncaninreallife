Holy shit, I just found out there's such a thing as a technical writer. Whose whole job is to write documentation! I feel like this could be a great way in to the industry. GitLab is currently looking for technical writers, for example, and they look *dope as heck*. Wow, I'm actually excited about seeing a job posting. This is awesome! 

TODO: Figure out how to become a technical writer.
