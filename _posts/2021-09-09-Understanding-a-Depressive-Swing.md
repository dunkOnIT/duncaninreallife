Today is a really rough day from a mental health perspective. I'm just feeling totally like a failure. It sucks. My mood and motivation are just incredibly low. All I want to do is sleep. I've asked Nikki for a session, although that's a little scary as its going to cost money. 

Things I feel like a failure for:
* not being present enough for mom
* not replying to Andy's VN quickly
* missing the nomaste order this week
* not working enough hours
* not being able to get everything done despite all this time I have
* not doing more with myself (existentially/in general, idk)
* not being able to help Viv more with her work stuff
* not being able to just do 3.5hrs work/day
* not getting back to Gregor

What would I tell Nikki if we were going to have a session now?
* I feel like I'm in the midst of a depressive swing: low mood, low motivation, literally just want to sleep/escape/cry
* Can this stuff happen with particular triggers/causes? Possible ones for me would be: injury, not working enough, being worried about Viv's work, being worried about finances, worrying that I won't be able to work enough, video games/dopamine overload, not having something to obsess over/to devote myself to
* How does one get out of this? Do I just need to ride it out (and do I make it worse by trying to push myself?) 
* I'm just fed up with maintenance and always needing to problem solve and come up with solutions for stuff. Its like... I know what the right thing is but I don't want to do it? Why? Why wouldn't I want to sit by the balcony? Because its what I'm supposed to do... because the solution can't be as easy as just a minor change in behaviour? 
* Don't really feel like I have anything I can do for fun/recreation - its so hard to do anything without turning it into an identity/improvement thing. Maybe reading? But that can easily become obsessive. Maybe coding? ... Maybe coding. 
* It just feels like I'm in this constant pattern of needing maintenance, falling out of habits/rhythms and then needing to reestablish them. It doesn't feel like I'm going anywhere. 
* Difficult to really get into anything with Viv's work being so intense - always need to make sure I have spare capacity. Hard to do that while also kinda stressing about money etc. 
* Feeling a lot of weight of expectation from different people - "what are you doing" can be a difficult question.
* Want to implement some kind of mood tracking, but it feels overwhelming


What's been good recently?
* Coding
* Writing a blog
* Meetings with people where we solve problems

Ok, Nikki can only see me next week, so there's a degree to which I'm on my own here.

I just did an IQ test and got 135, which has energised me a bit. Having a nice problem to sink my brain into and the competitive element of it being timed seems to have helped for sure. 

I think the most practical thing I cant start doing is keeping a mood journal. Maybe I should use daylio? Maybe I could emulate it using Bluestacks so I can have access to it with PC as well? 

The main thing I'd need to figure out there are activity classifications. 

Alternatively, I could try and make my own? 


What would it look like? 
* Month stats (really enjoyed daylio's view of this!) 
* Weekly chart (main thing I look at regularly) 
* Event log (where I can note different events/triggers and how I'm doing afterwards
* Activities: Supercategories (eg, exercise) and subcategories (eg, rowing) 

Ok, busy setting up Daylio.

Let's think through the categories I would want before I try to set anything up there:

Mental Health:
* Generalised anxiety
* Perseveration
* Depression/demotivation
* Anticipatory anxiety

Exercise:
* walking
* running
* rowing
* bodyweight
* ankle physio
* core physio
* neck physio
* wrist physio

Maintenance:
* cleaned room
* cleaned kitchen
* chores out of house

Activities:
* blogging 
* coding
* internet surfing
* sex
* masturbation
* 

Pain:
* headache
* wrists/elbows
* back
* thighs
* ankle
