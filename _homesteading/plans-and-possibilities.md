# Overview & Options

As a reminder, my 5-step plan is: 
1. Build financial capital
1. Learn to homestead
1. Find a community
1. Find land
1. Move onto the land

There are a few ways to achieve his. 

## STAY PUT

## TRAVEL LIGHT (buspacking)

### Upsides
- Cheap
- Should be relatively mobile/independent
- Could help me figure out a good "minimalist/essentialist core"

### Downsides
- Loss of systems can lead to worse health and productivity
    - Inconsistent work setup = pain, less work done
    - Inconsistent food/diet = headaches/fatigue
    - Less consistent exercise = injury
- No 'homebase' can make things a lot more uncomfortable 

### Notes
Perhaps I need to set up a basic minimalist core and then just be ok with buying stuff when I'm in places - eg very warm/cool clothes, specific gear, etc

## MOTOCAMP
Dangerous because motorbike, pretty high on the adventure scale.

## CARPACK
This might be the cheapest/easiest option.

## BAKKIECAMP
I do kinda like the idea of being a mobile homestead-improving self-sufficient human

This would _not_ be light on fuel _at all_, but it lets me bring a bunch of tools, and if it's a closed cab it gives me somewhere solid to hide from the heat/cold. I'm not sure about a comfortable "office" setup, though - perhaps I could do some kind of conversion with the seats? Idk.

Thinking about it more, it does give a LOT of flexibility - the only issue is sleeping. Could I live out of a bakkie? Maybe.

Downside is having a bakkie that could have any number of issues. Also people with other properties will often already have bakkies. 


## TRAVEL HEAVY (cargo trailer)

### Upsides
- I get a cargo trailer that could be used for temporary housing eventually

### Downsides
- Very expensive to move the cargo trailer around, not very mobile either

# What are my requirements? 
- Somewhere to sleep
- Somewhere to work
- 

## Optional extras
- 4G antennae
- Tools

# Travelling Light

The idea would be to try and have a setup at home that is highly mobile, so that there is the minimum possible disruption when going somewhere else. Checklists would also be crucial.

## What to bring
- Exercise
    - Yoga mat
    - Rings
    - [Sandbag](https://rebelstore.co.za/product/rebel-sand-bags/)? (this actually seems like a great idea)
- Work
    - 4G Router + SIM
    - Laptop
    - Charger
    - Laptop power brick
    - Desk? ([collapsible](https://www.takealot.com/foldable-laptop-desk-bed-table/PLID71885069?colour_variant=Black) floor/lap desk?)
    - ...voyager keyboard?
        - Seems like overkill but I do need to be careful of how much I'm working on my keyboard
        - maybe I should just fix the moonlander
    - Power station?
    - Flexi solar panel? 
        - Very expensive - 5k for 100W eesh. Better off buying panels at the location probably.
- Food?
- Work clothes
    - I still need to work these out for home lol. Sturdy pair of boots with quick-release laces?
- Work essentials
    - Leatherman
    - Gloves
- Sleeping & comfort
    - Sleeping back
    - Neck pillow
    - Normal pillow?
- Medication/toiletries
    - Can buy vitB and omega at pharmacies
    - Might want to reduce dosage/start stocking up on luvox
    - Rehidrate
    - Valium
    - Painkillers
    - Toothbrush + toothpaste
    - Comb, soap, hair scrub

- Cubing
    - Main
    - Blindfold
    - Headphones
    - Cube cover
    - Multi cubes? (8-16)

## How to pack

Basically I'd want to onebag with an extra duffel for conveniences.

### Bag 1 (backpack) - all essentials:
Osprey Farpoint 40 looks pretty good ngl

- Laptop
- 

### Bag 2 (duffel) - extras that make things liveable/better:
- battery packs
- sleeping back
- cubes/working stuff

## Things I can courier
- Medication if needed
- Multi cubes? 

## Things I can just buy
- Gumboots
- Tent if needed


## Travel
Combination of busses, private cars, ubers, and meter-taxis

## Accommodation
Stay with cubers, AirBnbs, labour exchanges

## Food
This will be a difficulty - I'm someone who relies on staples, and who struggles with inadequate nutrition and it will be difficult to bring food with me.

## Questions 
What would I do about rent at Schoolfarm?
