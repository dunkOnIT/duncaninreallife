# ToDo
- When tank drains, inspect for leaks
- Fix leaks if found
- Install water level measure (float and weight connected by fishing line through hole drilled in top of tank)
- Strongly consider installing a 1000L "staging tank", so that I can't lose all 5000L at once

# What I'd do differently:
- Get 30cm spaced drip tape - spacing every 15cm means using 2x the water for nothing, and most plants can't go that cose
- Do 2-3 lines, not 4

# Maintenance
- Fixing leaks 

# Challenges
- Monitoring water usage (water gauges are hard to find)
- Monitoring tank level
# Learnings:
- Carrying the tank up the hill with no path (put it on an aluminium frame which helped a lot)
- Determining sufficient elevation for water pressure
