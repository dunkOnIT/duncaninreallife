## WHAT DO _I_ MEAN BY HOMESTEADING? 
- Outside the city
- Off grid for energy and water
- Moving towards self-sufficiency for food production

## WHY HOMESTEADING? 

### Good for society
At its best, it offers a hopeful, centralized solution to the major problems which concern me in the world.

Falling short of the best, it aligns well with my personality and helps me to contribute less to the problems in the world.

### Good for me
- I vastly prefer rural life to city life.
- I want to cease my dependence on a paying job for survival

## DOWNSIDES OF HOMESTEADING
- Tremendous upfront cost
- Few examples of people doing it long-term that I know of (although it has been the primary way of living for most of human history lol)
- Systems require upkeep, it gets hard to leave the homestead
- Car reliance or significant isolation

## WHAT'S THE LONG-TERM VISION? 
Be on land I have the right to, as part of a hopefully-diverse, inter-dependent community of people who share the vision.

## HOW WILL I GET THERE? 

These items are presented in chronological and priority order.

1. Build financial capital
1. Learn to homestead
1. Find a community
1. Find land
1. Move onto the land

I want to be moving onto land that I have rights to by the time I'm 33 - so in 5 years (by 2028).

### 1. Build financial capital

In the long-term, homesteading _should_ get cheaper. In the short-medium term, homesteading is very expensive. There are two main reasons:
1. Land
2. Capital outlay

When I first got interested in homesteading, I radically underestimated the cost of setting up a homestead. The less skilled you are, the more this costs.

I estimate that if I were doing this on my own, I'd need access to ~2 million Rand, with 50% of that being land, ~25% being housing, and the balance being homestead capital - vehicles, tools, and so on.

The main way of reducing this cost would be to (a) reduce the cost of land, and (b) to pool resources with others for capital investments. Donated, rented or borrowed land can reduce the cost, but there is definitely a danger in not having rights to the land. (There's a lot to be said on communal ownership, why rights to the land is important, etc - that's a separate discussion.)

### 2. Learn to homestead

Homesteading requires a vast array of general skills (growing plants, DIY, mechanics, animal husbandry), as well as a significant amount of contextual knowledge on how to apply these skills in your climate and environmental conditions (vegetation, soil type). The amount of "unknown unknowns" is _vast_. 

Once these skills are acquired, I think homesteading gets a lot easier, cheaper, more productive and faster. Acquiring those skills (on ones own/largely independently) takes a lot of money and time - the sooner I start, the faster it pays off. 

### 3. Find a community

A community increases the rate of learning and access to knowledge and skills, while decreasing the amount of money/capital required - to say nothing of the human benefits of being part of a fulfilling community! 

As such, I'd like to work on meeting people in a number of different categories: 
- people interested in/doing homesteading & related topics (permaculture, agroecology, farming, self-sufficiency, etc)
- people interested in/doing communal living of some kind (eco-villages, intentional community, homesteading communities)
- people with excess land 
- people who share these interests outside of my race and class

### 4. Find land

Actually acquiring land will be a ways off, but I can do an number of things in the interim: 
- Build connections with landowners
- Try living in a number of different areas, and determine where I might like to live (both in terms of climate and geographic area)
- Determine what my "non-negotiables" on a piece of land would be
- Figure out how much land I would need

### 5. Move onto the land

This is still very far off, but there will be a few key elements:
- Fast/temporary housing, so that I can put my time into systems when first arriving on the land
- Keep possessions manageable enough that I can move potentially long distances
