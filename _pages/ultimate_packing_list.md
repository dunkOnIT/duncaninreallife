I ALWAYS get stressed when I need to pack to go away. I'm writing this list so that I never have to stress again.   

Packing scenarios:
    * Camping trip (no power)
    * Camping trip (power)
    * Weekend away (cabin)
    * Extended time away
    * Hike / outdoors  

I can sort of conceive of going away as a set of concentric circles of need, with each circle out adding more. 

If I were to think about this as a database, packing items would have the following properties:
* Need level (ie, scenario)
* Container
  * Default/suggested
  * Container in use

Packing categories:
* Food
*
