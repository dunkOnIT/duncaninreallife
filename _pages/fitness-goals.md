### Lower:
*** Run a 5k**
* No hip pain

# Plan towards goals

## Muscle-up

1. Establish a baseline of strength by doing the r/bodyweightfitness recommended routine 3x per week until I can do 15x pushups and pullups per set
1. Then try doing a muscle-up natty
1. Look into getting resistance bands if that doesn't work


## 5k 

1. Physio program including barefoot running exercises and hip-strengthening
   1. Good forefoot form
   2. Left knee aligned 
2. Do couch-to-5k on grass
3. Once I hit 5km, start doing a sprint-training and interval training program for ultimate


### Stage 1 - Barefoot running + hip training physio program

* Ankle warmup : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wp5kAIarAc
  * Toe presses
  * Ankle side-to-sides

#### Hip training





## Six-pack

This is going to be a tough one, as I need to probably be on a (slight) calorie excess while building up my legs and upper body. Probably need to forget about looking good during the first 3 months, and look to cut from June onwards at least. 

However, I think I could make my life easier by doing intermittent fasting and lining up when I work out. Also tracking calories and making sure I don't massively overeat?
