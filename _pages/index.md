# About Me 

I'm a 28-year-old Capetonian. My day job is software development, which I'm using to fund my explorations into homesteading.

## My Vision

I believe homesteading/small-scale farming is the most efficient and fulfilling way I can address the societal and socioeconomic problems I perceive in the world. I am currently trying to learn as much as I can, and I hope to end up in a diverse community of people trying to live sustainably and build resilience through inter-dependence. 

I want to become a good steward of land - someone who can help others to improve their land, and who contributes to the restoration of the environment. For now, I am focusing on learning as much as I can - by experimenting in the context I'm currently on (renting a room on a farm outside Cape Town), and by visiting other farms and homesteads, trading my labour for learning.

## Fun facts

I'm an avid speedcuber, specializing in solving the Rubik's Cube blindfolded. I currently hold the African Record for "multiblind", with 25/30 cubes memorized and solved in an hour. I am also highly involved in the local speedcubing scene, acting as a competition organizer and the secretary of CubingZA.

# Skills
- Basic mechanical skills (filter changes, bleeding/replacing brakes, water/radiator, working of a petrol engine)
- Basic irrigation (installing Jojo tank, running/joining irrigation line, setting up drip line, connecting filters and pressure gauges, calculating head and catchment)
- Basic care for laying flock (basically I'm comfortable with hens and roosters, laying vs brooding cycles, etc)
- Very basic DIY skills (jigsaw, screws and nails - skilsaw is still scary)
- Completed a Permaculture Design Course under Geoff Lawton (not much practical experience yet, but hopefully I know some of the right questions to ask)
- _Very_ basic understanding of electrified fencing (was labour on setting up a permanent electrified fence, also currently using a static poultry fence)
- Manual labour - I'm working on my stamina, I'd say I'm good for a consistent 2-4 hours of hard work (digging holes in the hot sun) a day at the moment
