## My First Jekyll Blog

This is the first time I've tried writing a Jekyll blog, and I'm pretty excited to see if it will work. 

If it does, it'll mean I've given this really, *really* old laptop we've got (2GB RAM, 1.86ghz dual core) new life as the blog machine I can use from bed. Aka, my happy place :)

The only decision I'll have is whether to use nano or another text editor, as nano doesn't seem to respect the page boundaries, similar to notepad. (Update - a quick google search helped me find nano's "soft wrapping" feature, by pressing Esc and then Shift+4... so that's one problem solved! Pretty excited to feel like a real hacker by doing all this stuff from the command line :D 

The only danger is if I lose an entire file because I'm so used to autosaving... yikes...
